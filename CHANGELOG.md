# Changelog

All notable changes to Synapse are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Full, per-release notes live under [`docs/release-notes/`](docs/release-notes/) and on
the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Emanuele-Chiummo/llm-wiki-synapse/releases) page.

## [Unreleased]

- `fix(ops)`: the automations card now reports the true classification outcome
  (`dormant` / `error` / counts) instead of a blind "ok" (#1).

## [1.3.5] — 2026-07-06

### Changed
- **`schema.md` is now the full llm_wiki contract**, not a stub: page-type→directory map,
  naming conventions, complete frontmatter (incl. `lang` + source `authors/year/url/venue`),
  index/log format, cross-referencing and contradiction-handling rules (K1 layer 3).
- **`log.md` is a narrative, day-grouped diary** (nashsu/llm_wiki parity) instead of a
  machine marker log: `## YYYY-MM-DD` headers + `- HH:MM:SSZ · <verb> · <type> · [[Title]] — path`
  bullets. Still append-only and machine-parseable (K4 preserved); one entry per ingest
  (AC-K4-1). Page deletion routes through the same `append_log` writer.

### Added
- **`created` / `updated` frontmatter** on every generated wiki page (`write_wiki_page`):
  `created` preserved across re-generation, `updated` advances each write.

### CI
- Bumped deprecated (Node 20) GitHub Action pins across all workflows: `actions/checkout`
  v4→v5, `docker/build-push-action` v5→v7, `docker/login-action` v3→v4,
  `docker/setup-buildx-action` v3→v4, `docker/setup-qemu-action` v3→v4.

See [`docs/release-notes/v1.3.5.md`](docs/release-notes/v1.3.5.md) for the full notes.

## [1.3.3] — 2026-07-05

### Fixed
- **Deep Research is PDF-proof**: SearXNG results pointing at a PDF were stored as raw
  bytes and killed the whole run in Postgres. PDFs now go through the ingest extractor
  (Marker when configured, else pypdf), other binaries are skipped with a log, all text
  is NUL-sanitized, and a single unstorable source no longer aborts the run.
- **Chat `[n]` citations open correctly**: click-through now navigates by page UUID with
  a `GET /pages/by-slug/{slug}` fallback for historical messages (was 422).

## [1.3.2] — 2026-07-05

### Fixed
- Setup wizard: backend server URL is now an editable, validated field.
- Deep Research: zero-source runs no longer synthesize and ingest a junk page.
- Search: relevance `%` chip shown only for vector results (no more 2144% from graph
  expansion).
- Review queue: the auto-resolve button is relabeled to disambiguate it from "clear
  resolved".

## [1.3.1] — 2026-07-05

### Changed
- Multi-arch frontend image builds the Vite bundle natively (minutes, not the 4h+ QEMU
  emulation of 1.3.0).
- CI E2E job green for the first time: seeded stack + 122+ Playwright tests on every push
  to `main`; hardware-aware skips for Ollama/GPU-dependent tests.
- New `release-cut` and `release-notes-sync` workflows; release notes versioned in
  `docs/release-notes/`.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-07-05 — "Foundations" 🏗️

The sprint that pays down structural debt before multi-vault (v1.4 → 2.0). No new AI
features by design. First release cut from `main` under the new tagging policy.

### Changed
- `main.py` decomposed from 9,311 → ~1,400 lines across 13 domain routers; API contract
  frozen and proven (byte-identical OpenAPI).
- Release lineage realigned: v1.2.4–1.2.6 merged into `main`; "tags are cut only from
  main" rule documented in CONTRIBUTING.

### Fixed
- Graph recompute (igraph/FA2/Louvain) moved to a thread executor — no more server
  freeze on large vaults.
- Chat responses bound to their originating conversation; stream aborts on switch/unmount.
- Atomic `index.md` writes, provider streams closed on timeout, word-boundary wikilinks,
  concurrent-edit `409`, and ~14 other regression-tested fixes (2 P1 + 18 P2).

### Security
- SSRF guard on deep-research fetches (http/https only, private/metadata IP blocking, max
  3 redirects).
- Per-method auth exemptions, Postgres no longer host-exposed, per-IP rate limiting on
  chat/ingest/research.

### Added
- Responsive mobile/tablet/desktop layouts (ADR-0057): drawers, safe-area insets, `100dvh`,
  and touch-reactive interactions (no ~350ms tap delay, ≥44px targets).

## [1.2.0] — 2026-07-03 — "Home & Insights"
